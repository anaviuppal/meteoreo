# meteoreo
Predicts the number of meteors visible per hour based for a user-specified date, time, and location. Takes into account Class I and Class II meteor showers as specified at https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/2020-meteor-shower-list/, as well as sporadic meteors. The meteor number is corrected based on the location's local light pollution.
